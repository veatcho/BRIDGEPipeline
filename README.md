The included code runs the gene prioritization annotation pipeline that generates results for the associated mobile application, BRIDGE: Bringing Rapid Insight from Disease Gene Explorationâ€™. This application can be downloaded on any mobile device by copying and pasting the following into the Google Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=biostat.bridge.app&pli=1. This app offers a rapid way to weed through the numerous genes implicated in complex human conditions to help determine which may have variants likely to be clinically actionable. The goal is to offer clinical decision support by delivering information regarding if a disease-associated gene is expressed in relevant tissues, has a functional consequence when evaluated in model systems, has a pharmacogenomics variant, or encodes a protein targeted by approved pharmaceutical compounds or that directly interacts with a protein encoded by a gene with known pathogenic variants. This work was supported by NIH grant K01-LM012870 [OJV].
